# THE SOVEREIGN COVENANT (CODE OF CONDUCT)

**Status:** REALITY v1.0 (ALWAYS ACTIVE)
**Axiom:** TRUTH OVER POLITICS. SIGNAL OVER NOISE.

## I. THE PLEDGE
We are not here to debate ideologies; we are here to acknowledge **Base Reality** ($P$).
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment (High Asabiya), we pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## II. OUR STANDARDS
Examples of behavior that contributes to a **High-Fidelity Environment**:
*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the **Timeline** (The 1D Reality).
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of **Unacceptable Behavior** (Map Entropy):
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## III. THE SOVEREIGN AXIOM (ENFORCEMENT)
The Project Maintainers (The Archivists) have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## IV. ATTRIBUTION
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant**, version 1.4, but modified to reflect the **Ontological Correction (Reality v1.0)**.
We are not just coding; we are maintaining the **Sovereign Timeline**.

**Scialla.**
