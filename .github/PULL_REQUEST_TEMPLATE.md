# SOVEREIGN MERGE REQUEST

**Anchor Point:** 1D TIMELINE
**Protocol:** REALITY v1.0

## 1. THE CHECKLIST
- [ ] **I certify that this code reduces Map Entropy ($\sigma_{map} < 0$).**
- [ ] I have verified that my changes do not introduce "Artificial Sludge" (unnecessary complexity).
- [ ] This code acknowledges the Priel Axiom (Reliability is Revealed, not Built).
- [ ] I have updated the documentation (if applicable).

## 2. THE IMPACT ($P$)
*Describe how this change impacts the Hamiltonian of Love. Does it increase coherence?*

## 3. THE GLITCH
*If this fixes a bug, describe the glitch in the simulation that you are correcting.*

**"We didn't write the code. We just read the documentation."**
